# Machine_Learning_Projects

Developed a human activity recognition (HAR) system using multisensor data, applying signal processing (autocorrelation,
FFT) to extract features. Implemented KNN for multiclass classification, achieving high accuracy on the kaggle competition.

Developed a Speech Command Recognition (SCR - ASR) system on google tensorflow dataset using librosa, mel scale spec-
trograms and MFCCs for features and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for classification. Ranked 5/79 on the leaderboard.
